# CBIR
An python implementation of content-based image retrieval, which I developed during my bachelor's project in Computer Science. <br>
code/ contains subfolder code/lib/ which defines different ways of calculating image features. code/ also contains some jupyter-notebooks that use the library code/lib/ <\br>
code/lib/features.py contains KAZE, Harralick and LBP features. <br>
code/lib/MLMethod.py computes features using a CNN. <br>
code/lib/vggModel.py performs transfer learning, by further training the pre-trained image classifier VGG16 on medical images.
