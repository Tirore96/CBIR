# CBIR
An python implementation of content-based image retrieval, which I developed during my bachelor's project in Computer Science.
lib/ contains different techniques for calculating image features. 
features.py contains KAZE, Harralick and LBP features
MLMethod.py computes features using a CNN
vggModel.py performs transfer learning, by further training the pre-trained image classifier VGG16 on medical images.
